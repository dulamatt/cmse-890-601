    "The list-based methods clearly take longer, because they again require more cache list fetches. There is a speedup using the `sum` function, likely because it makes use of values remaining in the cache and register and summing them all at once as opposed to alternating between value creation and summing. I cannot explain why the NumPy iteration takes longer than the list iteration. However, the NumPy vectorized multiplication inside of the `np.sum` function speeds up the process significantly by taking advantage of the cached values during multiplication and then again the easily-accessible cached values of the NumPy array during summation. Finally, the `np.dot` function uses a similar process, using cached summands and products together."
